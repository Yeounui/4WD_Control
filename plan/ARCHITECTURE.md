# Architecture

Behavioral contracts only — no implementation bodies (per
`.claude/rules/Edit_Workflow.md`). Struct field layouts live in the headers; this
file states each unit's responsibility, I/O, and call connections.

## Entry Points & Control-Loop Call Graph

The system has one synchronous super-loop plus four asynchronous ISR/callback entry
points. The active control path is rooted in the main loop after `dt` is computed;
do not read the per-wheel PID, S-curve, line sensor, or FSM state handlers as
orphaned.

### `main()` — boot + super loop
- Init order: CubeMX peripheral init → `Motor_Init` → `Encoder_Init` → `FSM_Init`
  → `HC06_Init` → `SoftI2C_Init` → `LineSensor_Init` → `MPU6050_Init` →
  `Kalman_Init` → speed PID init → `LCD_Init`.
- Then loops; `HC06_Process` and pending parameter saves are checked every pass,
  while sensor/control/display work is paced from `HAL_GetTick()`.

### Control tick — orchestrator

| Step | Calls | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Bluetooth/service | `HC06_Process`, parameter-save request handling | every super-loop pass |
| Timebase | compute `dt` from `HAL_GetTick()` | every control pass with `dt > 0` |
| Speed loop | `Encoder_Sample` → `Encoder_GetSpeed` ×4 → `PID_Update(pid_speed)` ×4 → `Motor_SetDuty` ×4 | each `SPEED_PERIOD_MS` |
| IMU + yaw estimate | `MPU6050_Read` → `Kalman_Update` | every control pass |
| Line sensor | `LineSensor_Read` | every control pass; ADC1-DMA refreshes its buffer asynchronously |
| FSM/profile/state | `FSM_Dispatch(yaw, omega_dps, dt, line_error, line_active)`; STRAIGHT calls `SCurve_Update` + `PID_Update(pid_yaw)`, LINE_TRACE calls `PID_Update(pid_line)` | every control pass after sensor reads |
| Telemetry | `YAW=`, `SPD=`, `CNT=` over USART2 | each `STREAM_PERIOD_MS` |
| Display | `LCD_Update` | each `LCD_PERIOD_MS` |

### ISR / callback entry points
- **LL EXTI Hall (PB0/PB1/PB2/PA4)** → clear the pending line, then
  `Encoder_OnPulse` (per wheel).
- **LL EXTI Shock (PA6)** → clear the pending line, then
  `FSM_RequestEmergencyFromISR` — latches emergency and stops motors if the FSM is initialized.
- **USART2 DMA RX** → `HC06_OnReceive`; command parsing is drained by `HC06_Process`.
- **ADC1 DMA half/full complete callbacks** → `line_sensor.c` marks a fresh sample
  after confirming `hadc == &hadc1`.

## Modules

### motor — `motor.{h,c}`
Owns the four H-bridge PWM direction pairs. Positive signed duty drives the
forward input, negative signed duty drives the reverse input, and zero duty
coasts/stops with both compare values at 0. Phase 1 uses open-loop duty; later
PID phases can feed this signed-duty actuator.

| Fn | Responsibility | Input | Output / effect | Connections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Motor_Init` | Start all PWM channels and set compares to 0 | — | all motors stopped/coasting | called by `main` |
| `Motor_SetDuty` | Clamp signed duty and write exactly one compare channel non-zero | `id` (LF/RF/LR/RR), signed duty | one motor forward/reverse/coast | called by speed/drive logic; calls HAL TIM compare macros |
| `Motor_SetDirection` | Convenience full-scale forward/reverse/stop wrapper | `id` (LF/RF/LR/RR), direction | one motor forward/reverse/stopped | called by direct test/manual helpers; calls `Motor_SetDuty` |
| `Motor_SetAll` | Apply one direction to all four motors | direction | all motors updated | calls `Motor_SetDirection` ×4 |
| `Motor_StopAll` | Set every motor signed duty to 0 | — | all motors stopped/coasting | called by init/emergency/idle paths |

### pid — `pid.{h,c}`
Generic PID with anti-windup. Three uses: `pid_yaw`, `pid_speed` (×4), `pid_line`.
See [[OVERVIEW]] for what each corrects.

| Fn | Responsibility | Input | Output | Connections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PID_Update` | One PID step with integral clamp + output clamp | `pid*`, setpoint, measurement, `dt` | control output (float) | called by FSM straight (`pid_yaw`), speed loop (`pid_speed`), line handler (`pid_line`) |
| `PID_Reset` | Clear integral + prev_error | `pid*` | effect: state zeroed | called by FSM/speed-loop transition and disabled-output paths |

`R` measured from stationary samples; bias/R can be persisted through `paramstore`.

### soft_i2c — `soft_i2c.{h,c}`
Bit-bang I2C master on PB6/PB7. This is the permanent sensor/display bus because
hardware I2C conflicts with motor PWM on this pin stack (see [[DECISIONS]] §D10).

| Fn | Responsibility | Input | Output | Connections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SoftI2C_Init` | Configure the software I2C pins/open-drain behavior | — | bus ready | called by `main` before I2C devices |

### encoder — `encoder.{h,c}`
DIY Hall-sensor wheel encoder. RPM from pulse count over a fixed sample window:
`RPM = (Δpulses / ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_REV) / dt · 60`. `ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_REV`
is Hall magnets × 2 (both EXTI edges counted); placeholder `20.0f`, tune to
hardware.

### line_sensor — `line_sensor.{h,c}`

buffer and exposes a normalized single-sensor line offset placeholder until
hardware calibration defines the real raw range and center.

allocation-free, and stores current speed, current acceleration, target,
acceleration limit, jerk limit, and phase.

### fsm — `fsm.{h,c}`
Central 7-state machine. Holds current state + per-state context. It publishes
per-wheel RPM setpoints for the speed PID loop; only idle/emergency/reset paths
stop motors directly.

**States:** `IDLE · STRAIGHT · LINE_TRACE · TURN · AVOID · MANUAL · EMERGENCY`

**Transitions:**
```
IDLE       → STRAIGHT    : auto start / AT+FWD
IDLE       → LINE_TRACE  : line detected / AT+LINE
IDLE       → MANUAL      : HC-06 manual command
STRAIGHT   → TURN        : AT+LEFT / AT+RIGHT
STRAIGHT   → AVOID       : obstacle (VL53L1X; future)
LINE_TRACE → AVOID       : obstacle (VL53L1X; future)
TURN       → STRAIGHT    : integrated |ω|·dt ≥ θ_goal
AVOID      → TURN        : start avoidance rotation (future)
AVOID      → STRAIGHT    : avoidance complete (future)
MANUAL     → IDLE        : AT+STOP / disconnect path
ANY        → EMERGENCY   : shock EXTI — overrides all
EMERGENCY  → IDLE        : BT AT reset, only if shock input is clear
```

| Fn | Responsibility | Input | Output / effect | Connections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FSM_Init` | Initialize state/context and yaw/line PID placeholder gains | — | effect: state=IDLE unless emergency latched | called by `main` |

| `FSM_Turn_Update` | Gyro-integrated pivot turn | `omega_dps`, `dt`, implicit 90° placeholder target | effect: pivot RPM targets; on done stop + →STRAIGHT | calls `FSM_ApplyMotion`, `FSM_SetState(STRAIGHT)` |
| `FSM_ApplyMotion` | Map forward/left/right/stop to per-wheel RPM targets | motion | effect: `speed_setpoint[]` updated | used by TURN and MANUAL paths |
| `FSM_IsMotionEnabled` | Tell the speed loop whether PID output may drive motors | — | bool | true for STRAIGHT/TURN, true for LINE_TRACE only after valid line-sensor dispatch, true for non-stop MANUAL, false for idle/fail-safe states |
| `FSM_GetSpeedSetpoint` | Return one wheel's current RPM target | wheel | RPM setpoint | consumed by speed PID loop |

`AVOID` currently fails safe by zeroing targets until the VL53L1X module lands.
Phase 5 yaw gains, turn angle, S-curve accel/jerk limits, Phase 7 line gains,
line calibration, and correction signs are tuning placeholders until hardware
verification.

```
Default I2C addr 0x52. With all XSHUT LOW (all off):
  1. Release XSHUT_FRONT → power Front only → set addr 0x54
  2. Release XSHUT_LEFT  → power Left only  → set addr 0x56
  3. Release XSHUT_RIGHT → Right keeps default 0x52
```
