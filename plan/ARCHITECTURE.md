# Architecture

Behavioral contracts only — no implementation bodies (per
`.claude/rules/Edit_Workflow.md`). Struct field layouts live in the headers; this
file states each unit's responsibility, I/O, and call connections.

## Entry Points & Control-Loop Call Graph

The system has one synchronous entry point (the main super-loop tick) plus three
asynchronous ISR entry points. **The 10 ms tick is the call-graph root** — every
controller below is reached from it; do not read the per-wheel PID or S-curve
functions as orphaned.

### `main()` — boot + super loop
- Init order: `Motor_Init` → `HC06_Init` → `MPU6050_Init` → `Encoder` setup →
  `FSM_Init` → (`LCD_Init`, `TOF_Init_All` as phases land).
- Then loops; on each 10 ms SysTick flag it runs **one control tick**.

### Control tick (100 Hz) — orchestrator
Runs every 10 ms, in order:

| Step | Calls | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Read IMU | `MPU6050_Read` → omega, accel-angle | every tick |
| Yaw estimate | `Kalman_Update` | every tick |
| Speed loop | `Encoder_GetSpeed` ×4 → `PID_Update(pid_speed)` ×4 → `Motor_SetDuty` ×4 | every tick |
| Profile | `SCurve_Update` | every tick |
| State handler | `FSM_Dispatch` (runs current state's handler) | every tick |
| Ranging | `TOF_ReadDistance_mm` / `TOF_IsObstacle` | every 5 ticks (50 ms) |
| Display | `LCD_Update` | every 20 ticks (200 ms) |

### ISR entry points
- **LL EXTI Hall (PB0/PB1/PB2/PA4)** → clear the pending line, then
  `Encoder_OnPulse` (per wheel).
- **LL EXTI Shock (PA6)** → clear the pending line, then
  `FSM_SetState(EMERGENCY)` — overrides all states.
- **USART2 DMA RX** → `HC06_OnReceive` → `HC06_Parse` on line terminator.

## Modules

### motor — `motor.{h,c}`
Owns the four H-bridge PWM direction pairs. Positive signed duty drives the
forward input, negative signed duty drives the reverse input, and zero duty
coasts/stops with both compare values at 0. Phase 1 uses open-loop duty; later
PID phases can feed this signed-duty actuator.
